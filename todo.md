# DONE:
- A complete beginner's guide to deploying web applications
- rebuild sioyek
- Learning through fast feedback
- FAQ: should I stick to one course or jump around? this is the question I want to ask too, should I stick to one project instead of creating as more projects as I want, should I stick to the PhotoShare project? (interest to me and fit my goal)
